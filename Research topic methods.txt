Research methods and approaches

	To conduct an extensive review of existing research on AI-driven emotion recognition, NLP un education, and adaptive e-learning system a Literature Review method will be used. Target is to identify current gaps, best practices, and successful case studies. Systematic Benchmarking could be used to identify and select the best AI tools relevant for e-learning integration. Criteria for this evaluation is defined: accuracy, real-time capability, privacy, integration flexibility, and personalization. Experimental prototype development of e-learning model with integrated AI emotion recognition and NPI tool can be used to ensure that the prototype can collect real-time learner data, process emotional cues, and adapt learning paths accordingly ensuring personalization. If necessary, Testing and User Studies can be performed by conducting experiments with real users interacting with the prototype. Data will be collected – quantitative (system metrics, engagement scores) and qualitative (user feedback, interviews). Comparative analysis method will be used at the end of research to compare AI tool performance to previously defined criteria. Based on experimental results, a conclusion and evaluation will be given.

Research data: Acquisition, Processing, and Analysis

As described in methods acquisition will be done by gathering data from user interactions within the prototype (emotional reactions, engagement metrics, learning outcomes). Emotion and text data will be processed by normalization, anonymization, and feature extraction. AI models data will be classified (face/video analysis, text sentiment analysis). Only necessary, anonymized data that compliance with GDPR, ethnical standards and AI act will be stored. All stored data will be analyzed with two given methods: Quantitative and Qualitative. Quantitative method will calculate emotion recognition accuracy, measure latency in ms/s for real-time feedback and assess improvement in engagement and learning outcomes via user pre-test and user post-tests. Qualitative method will analyze user feedback on adaptivity, privacy, and usability.
 
Research results and deliverables

	The expected result of research is quantitative evaluation of AI tools against defined criteria, empirical evidence of impact on learner engagement, motivation, and outcomes, comparative analysis highlighting best tools or approaches for e-learning integration. The expected deliverables of research are Literature review and benchmarking report, prototype of an AI-augmented e-learning module, dataset that is anonymized and evaluation scripts, document with methodology, findings and recommendations, some possible guidelines for integrating AI emotion recognition into e-learning platforms.
