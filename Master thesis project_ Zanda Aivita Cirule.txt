Introduction  Enhancing E - Learning with Emotional Intelligence :  •   The rise of   e - learning   highlights the need for   personalized student  support .  •   Emotional well - being   plays a crucial role in   academic success .  •   Artificial Intelligence (AI)   enables real - time   emotion recognition .  •   AI can   adapt learning environments   to boost:  •   Engagement  •   Motivation  •   Learning outcomes  •   The integration of AI creates a more   responsive and supportive  learning experience.

Research problem  • Lack of emotional support   reduces  motivation and performance.  • Students often feel   isolated and  disengaged.  • AI's potential   to address these needs  remains   underused   and   impersonal.

Hypothesis  Null hypothesis (H ₀ ) :  The use of artificial intelligence in an e - learning  environment does not change students' emotional  well - being and learning engagement.  Alternative version (H1):  Students' emotional well - being and learning  engagement in an e - learning environment using  artificial intelligence solutions is the same as  without them.

Research question  •   How can artificial intelligence  provide personalized emotional  support in an e - learning  environment?

Page 7:
Research Objective  •   To analyze how artificial  intelligence can be used to provide  personalized emotional support in  e - learning environments to  improve students' emotional well -  being and learning engagement.

Research Relevance and  Rationale  •   Emotional disengagement is a major barrier  to effective learning, even as e - learning  platforms become widely adopted.  •   Current e - learning systems often cannot  recogn ize or respond to learners’ emotional  states.  •   Urgent need: Integrate AI, especially  emotion recognition and NLP, into e - learning  •   Goal: Provide personalized emotional  support and adaptive learning paths to  enhance the overall learning experience and  results
