This stage allowed us to synthesize the information  collected and provide a contextualized view of the literature  reviewed on the topic.  These thematic clusters were organized with the objective of  providing a coherent structure to analyze and synthesize the  information collected, thus facilitating the understanding of trends  and advances in the integration of artificial intelligence to evaluate  emotions in educational environments.  We used the following search terms: artificial intelligence terms  AND recognition of emotions AND educational context terms as  follows ( Figure 1 ):  Cluster 1 : “artificial intelligence” OR “machine intelligence” OR  “intelligent support” OR “intelligent virtual reality” OR “chat bot*” OR  “machine learning” OR “automated tutor” OR “personal tutor*” OR  “intelligent agent*” OR “expert system” OR “neural network” OR  “natural language processing.”  Cluster   2 :   “Emotion   recognition”   OR   “Speech   Emotion  Recognition” OR “Emotion Classification” OR “Emotional State” OR  “Facial Emotion Recognition” OR “Facial Emotions” OR “Emotion  Detection” OR “Emotionality” OR “Human Emotion” OR “Emotional  Speech” OR “Multimodal Emotion Recognition” OR “Emotional  Intelligence” OR “Automatic Emotion Recognition” OR “Human  Emotion Recognition” OR “Emotion Analysis.”  Cluster 3 : “educational” OR “educational environments” OR  “learning environments” OR “Educational Settings” OR “educational  context” OR “pedagogical environments” OR “academic settings” OR  “classroom environments” OR “learning spaces” OR “educational  institutions” OR “school environments” OR “educational facilities”  OR   “teaching   and   learning   environments”   OR   “educational  institutions” OR “school systems” OR “academic programs” OR  “higher   education”   OR   “pedagogical   approaches”   OR  “university campuses.”  Titles and abstracts were screened, and full reports of potentially  relevant studies were obtained using a Preferred Reporting Items for  Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) model ( Page et al.,  2021 ). Two authors (AORV and AD) independently assessed the  reports for eligibility, with discrepancies resolved by discussion with  a third author (JL).  We included quantitative studies in English, Spanish, and  Portuguese, and studies related to both virtual and face-to-face  educational environments. Articles were excluded based on the  following exclusion criteria: (1) if they referred to non-data-based  studies (e.g., editorials, commentaries, opinion papers, and review  papers), and (2) if stigmatizing attitudes were assessed among  non-physician primary care professionals, such as nurses, technicians,  social workers, and other professionals, among mental health  professionals, or among the general population. Data on study design,  sample characteristics, and findings were extracted independently by  three authors (MC, CAF and JLMA). Because of the heterogeneity  between studies, which hindered a statistical synthesis of their results,  we summarized evidence from articles included in the review through  a narrative synthesis ( Popay et al., 2006 ).  3 Results and discussion  One thousand and fifteen articles were identified in the four  databases (Scopus: 366, Web of Science: 203, Pubmed: 163 and  PsycINFO: 283). 135 articles were identified as potentially relevant  and were assessed against eligibility criteria. Forty-one studies fulfilled  FIGURE 1  Co-occurrence network. VOSviewer_1.6.18.

Every study included in the review used a cross-sectional design  or used databases to investigate the integration of artificial intelligence  (AI) for emotional assessment within educational contexts. Nine  studies were conducted in China, one in Colombia, Ecuador, Egypt,  Germany, seven in India, two in Iran, one in Japan and Jordan, two in  Morocco, two in Russia and Spain, one in Thailand, Tunisia and  United Arab Emirates, and five in the United States.  Based on the results of the articles included in the review, we can  consider that there are several points in common and others that are  more specific. We present the results and discussion based on each of  these topics:   emotion recognition in education, technology integration  and learning outcomes, special education and assistive technology,  affective computing.  3.1 Emotion recognition in education  Emotion recognition is essential for understanding how emotions  affect peer interactions, academic performance, and engagement in  online and virtual learning environments ( Standen et   al., 2020 ;  Dehbozorgi and Kunuku, 2023 ;   Villegas-Ch et al., 2023 ).  The main methods used in the research to analyze students’  emotional states were related to facial expressions, eye movements,  and biosignal data ( Ninaus et al., 2019 ;   Dehbozorgi and Kunuku, 2023 ;  Villegas-Ch et al., 2023 ;   Yugal et al., 2023 ). During online lessons,  monitoring systems studied real-time attention, emotions and feelings  ( He et al., 2022 ;   Dehbozorgi and Kunuku, 2023 ).  In   educational   settings,   the   use   of   artificial   intelligence,  particularly   machine   learning   and   deep   learning,   has   grown  increasingly popular. These technologies primarily enhance the speed  of analysis and the accuracy of emotion classification ( He et al., 2022 ;  Begum et   al., 2023 ;   Villegas-Ch et   al., 2023 ;   Yugal et   al., 2023 ).  Although artificial intelligence has seen significant advancements  recently, various models have also been employed for speech emotion  recognition to explore the relationship between emotions and  academic performance ( Dehbozorgi and Kunuku, 2023 ).  In this sense, numerous studies have performed detailed analyses  to uncover the relationship between students’ expressed emotions and  their academic performance ( Dehbozorgi and Kunuku, 2023 ;   Yugal  et al., 2023 ). Positive emotions like relief and satisfaction are strongly  Records identified from*: Databases (n=1015) Records removed   before screening : Duplicate records removed (n=76) Records marked as ineligible by automation tools (n=175) Records screened (n=804) Records excluded** (n=669) Reports assessed for eligibility (n=135) Reports excluded: Reviews (n = 41).

This comprehensive approach to integrating AI, ICT, and assistive  technology not only enhances emotional support but also equips  students with the tools they need to actively participate in their  education. Ultimately, this opens the door to a more successful and  inclusive educational process.  4.1 Limitations  This study aimed to review and analyze the existing literature on the  integration of artificial intelligence for evaluating emotions in educational  environments. The review relied on articles sourced from specific  academic databases, including PubMed, Web of Science, PsycINFO, and  Scopus. While these databases are significant in the scientific community,  it is crucial to note that this selection might have limited the inclusion of  pertinent research published in other sources or in gray literature.  Additionally, a linguistic bias is acknowledged; the review covered  articles in English, Spanish, and Portuguese, but research published in  other languages was not considered. This restriction might have  excluded studies that could provide valuable insights, affecting the  geographical and cultural representativeness of the studies included  in this analysis. Consequently, the generalizability of the findings to  different educational and cultural contexts may be limited.  Lastly, we recognize an open access bias. Despite efforts to include  a diverse range of academic sources and databases, some studies may  be behind paywalls. This limitation could have excluded significant  research, impacting the comprehensiveness of the review. Access was  restricted to studies that were either open access or available through  institutions with subscriptions. Therefore, caution is advised when  interpreting   the   findings   of   this   review,   as   they   may   not  comprehensively reflect all the available research in the field of  AI-driven emotional assessment in education.  4.1.1 Temporal limitation  The review findings may not fully represent the latest advances or  developments in AI-driven emotional assessment within education,  as the search was conducted up to the year 2023. Consequently,  emerging technologies, methodologies, or ethical considerations may  not be sufficiently covered, potentially limiting the relevance and  applicability of the study’s findings to current educational practices.  4.1.2 In terms of generalizability  While the review offers insights into the integration of AI for  emotional assessment in educational settings, the findings may not  be   broadly applicable across diverse educational environments,  student populations, and cultural contexts. Differences in educational  infrastructure, resources, and practices among various regions or  institutions could influence the feasibility and effectiveness of  implementing AI-driven approaches to emotional assessment.  4.2 Ethical considerations  Although the study acknowledges the importance of ethical  considerations in the development and implementation of AI  technologies within education, the review itself does not delve into the  ethical implications of using AI for emotional assessment. Further  exploration of ethical frameworks, privacy concerns, and potential  social impacts is needed to ensure responsible and equitable  implementation of AI technologies within educational settings.

In this context, emotions play a fundamental role in  the teaching-learning process given that they influence academic performance,  motivation, information retention, and student well-being. Thus, the integration  of AI in emotional assessment within educational environments offers several  advantages that can transform how we understand and address the socio-emotional  development of students. However, there remains a lack of comprehensive approach  that systematizes advancements, challenges, and opportunities in this field.  Aim:   This systematic literature review aims to explore how artificial intelligence  (AI) is used to evaluate emotions within educational settings. We   provide  a   comprehensive   overview   of   the   current   state   of   research,   focusing   on  advancements,   challenges,   and   opportunities   in   the   domain   of   AI-driven  emotional assessment within educational settings.

Vistorte et al.   10.3389/fpsyg.2024.1387089  Frontiers in   Psychology   02   frontiersin.org  Conclusion:   This systematic literature review showcases the significance of AI  in revolutionizing educational practices through emotion assessment. While  advancements are evident, challenges related to accuracy, privacy, and cross-  cultural validity were also identified. The synthesis of existing research highlights  the need for further research into refining AI models for emotion recognition  and emphasizes the importance of ethical considerations in implementing AI  technologies within educational contexts.  KEYWORDS  emotions, artificial intelligence, teaching-learning, education, assessment  1 Introduction  The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into educational  settings marks a significant advancement in detecting, assessing, and  nurturing students’ emotions. AI’s ability to analyze complex emotional  behavior patterns through data collected during the learning process  enables a deeper understanding of each student’s needs.  By employing advanced algorithms, AI can detect signs of  frustration, boredom, or enthusiasm, allowing educators to tailor  their teaching methods more effectively. Additionally, AI can provide  instant, personalized feedback based on emotional analysis, thereby  creating a learning environment that is more attuned to students’  emotional well-being. This comprehensive approach significantly  contributes to students’ holistic development, enhancing their ability  to manage emotions, build positive relationships, and improve their  academic performance.  In this regard   D’Mello and Graesser (2012)   raise that AI can  predict student emotions (boredom, fluency/engagement, confusion,  and frustration) by analyzing the text of dialogues between students  and tutors during interactions with an “Intelligent Tutoring System.”  These AI-driven intelligent tutoring systems can positively influence  student motivation by incorporating artificially intelligent educational  models,   such   as   the   “Mobile   Adaptive   Personalized   Learning  Environment” -MAPLE- ( Mehigan and Pitt, 2019 ). Thus, artificial  tutors with synthesized emotions can adapt their behavior to students’  reactions and affective states, improving their performance in  e-learning systems ( Florea and Kalisz, 2005 ).  Another interesting study argues that AI can help detect and  assess   students’   emotions   within   interactive   digital   learning  environments (IDLE) and adapt the environment accordingly to meet  their real needs, potentially improving learning ( Arguel et al., 2019 ).  AI may also classify students’ emotions during their interaction with  immersive environments, allowing for a better understanding of their  emotional experiences ( Rodríguez et al., 2020 ).  AI can also analyze emotions from text, enhancing student  motivation and performance in e-learning environments ( Rodriguez  et al., 2012 ). Simultaneously, it can gauge the intensity of emotions and  tailor lessons to individual needs, promoting successful completion of  academic studies ( Sumithra et al., 2022 ). Similarly, a recent study  found that using deep learning methods to detect students’ emotions  can significantly boost productivity and enhance the educational  process ( AlZu’bi et al., 2022 ).  In a systematic review,   de Oliveira and Rodrigues (2021)   discovered  that 60% of recent studies on human behavior and AI, specifically from  the past three and a half years, focus on emotion-driven organizations.  This trend highlights the growing interest and novelty of the field.  Among the efforts to incorporate AI into emotional management  within educational settings, the “Biologically Inspired Cognitive  Architecture” (eBICA) is notable. Developed by   Samsonovich (2020) ,  eBICA allows AI to understand and interact with human emotions  during social interactions. Additionally, the emotion-based artificial  decision-making model has been shown to enhance the performance  of educational agents in virtual settings ( Yang and Zhen, 2014 ). Another  approach involves the integration of emotional agents in AI-based  learning environments to improve learner motivation, self-assessment,  and self-motivation by improving the socioemotional climate ( Gorga  and Schneider, 2009 ), especially affective computing ( Kort et al., 2001 ;  González-Hernández et al., 2018 ;   Ninaus et al., 2019 ;   Shobana and  Kumar, 2021 ;   He et al., 2022 ;   Aly et al., 2023 ;   Villegas-Ch et al., 2023 ).  Recent advancements reveal that artificial intelligence (AI) can  not only recognize but also predict emotions ( Alm et al., 2005 ;   Lin  et   al., 2023 ;   Singh et   al., 2023 ). This capability extends beyond  identifying current emotional states, enabling systems such as virtual  assistants and Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS) to proactively adapt  and respond more effectively to students’ emotional needs, thus  enhancing the learning experience.  AI also significantly impacts social emotions such as empathy,  compassion,   and   interpersonal   phenomena   like   justice   and  cooperation, which are crucial for learning ( Lamm and Singer, 2010 ).  Furthermore, AI can analyze empathic behavior in dynamic social  contexts like educational settings. There are now models that use deep  learning to foster emotional intelligence, processing multimodal  emotional signals to generate appropriate empathic responses ( Alanazi  et al., 2023 ).  Overall, despite the challenges associated with AI’s empathic  abilities, it is acknowledged that AI offers valuable tools for promoting  empathic skills, essential for social cooperation, and ethical and  prosocial behavior ( Gómez-León, 2022 ).  The importance of AI in supporting mental health is finally  recognized, an area supported by hundreds of progressively increasing  studies ( Mohr et al., 2017 ;   Garcia-Ceja et al., 2018 ;   Graham et al.,  2019 ;   Shatte et al., 2019 ) taking into account that AI systems can  provide emotional support and personalized advice to students and  other educational actors experiencing stress or depression and provide  advice and feedback based on emotional well-being.  1.1 Intelligent tutoring systems and  emotions  Intelligent   Tutoring   Systems   (ITS)   are   closely   related   to  students’ emotions, since learning and emotions are an inseparable

Vistorte et al.   10.3389/fpsyg.2024.1387089  Frontiers in   Psychology   06   frontiersin.org  correlated with higher grades, suggesting that students experiencing  these emotions typically achieve better academically. Conversely,  negative emotions, such as frustration, are negatively correlated with  academic performance, indicating that students experiencing these  emotions often face academic challenges.  Positive emotional states have been associated with greater success  in completing class activities on time and better overall performance,  underscoring the importance of emotional well-being in academic  settings ( Dehbozorgi and Kunuku, 2023 ).  These technologies have been instrumental in identifying the  impact of emotions on learning outcomes, linking positive emotions  to improved cognitive processes and engagement ( He et al., 2022 ;  Villegas-Ch et al., 2023 ;   Yugal et al., 2023 ).  3.2 Technology integration and learning  outcomes  In the current educational landscape, integrating technology is  key to enhancing learning outcomes. Blending technological tools  with traditional teaching methods has created new opportunities to  enrich the educational experience and foster skill development in  students. The effectiveness of this integration is evident in its  adaptability to various learning styles, its ability to boost student  engagement,   and   its   role   in   providing   access   to   global  educational resources.  In the context of our research on using artificial intelligence to  assess emotions in learning environments, it is essential to understand  how this synergy between technology and learning outcomes can  improve the educational process and make achieving learning  objectives more effective and meaningful.  Technologies such as AI, machine learning, and deep learning are  employed to expedite emotion analysis and enhance classification  accuracy in educational settings ( He et al., 2022 ;   Dehbozorgi and  Kunuku, 2023 ). The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into the  management of emotions within education marks a significant  advancement in modern teaching methods. Research has shown that  machine learning techniques can reliably identify a range of human  emotions, including happiness, anger, sadness, and calmness ( Ramirez  and Vamvakousis, 2012 ).  This ability can significantly enhance teaching by providing a  deeper, more personalized understanding of students’ emotional  states. Such insights allow for the customization of teaching strategies  to better address individual needs. Effectively applying AI in managing  educational emotions can not only boost students’ overall well-being  but also foster a more inclusive and empathetic learning environment.  Improved   emotional   recognition   from   “EEG   signals”   can  be enhanced by integrating deep learning with shallow machine  learning techniques, which holds promising applications in human-  computer interaction ( Islam et al., 2021 ). This development signifies  a major research advancement, recognizing deep learning’s ability to  extract complex features from EEG signals and the role of shallow  machine learning in providing a clearer, more interpretable analysis.  Combining these approaches creates a synergistic effect, enhancing  the detection and understanding of emotions from EEG signals. Such  advancements could lead to innovative applications in human-  computer interaction, resulting in more intuitive and adaptive  interfaces that align with users’ emotions and needs.  Artificial intelligence-based educational models, like “MAPLE,”  are poised to positively influence student motivation and engagement  in e-learning environments by catering to their emotional needs  ( Mehigan and Pitt, 2019 ). This underscores the value of adaptability  and personalization in these systems, allowing for more targeted  responses to learners’ emotional states. By incorporating artificial  intelligence, educational environments become more responsive and  empathetic, thereby enhancing student engagement and satisfaction.  Another significant development is the emergence of affective  computing and sentiment analysis. These fields utilize human-  computer interaction, information retrieval, and multimodal signal  processing to analyze sentiments from online social data, providing  valuable insights for educational sciences ( Cambria, 2016 ;   Cambria  et al., 2017 ). These advancements facilitate a deeper understanding of  emotional experiences in digital settings, which can inform both online  and offline educational strategies. Integrating these emotional analytics  into education enhances the customization of teaching methods and  curriculum design to better meet students’ emotional needs, promoting  more effective and meaningful learning experiences.  3.2.1 Emotionally intelligent e-learning  Emotion recognition is vital for understanding the influence of  emotions   on   peer   interactions,   academic   performance,   and  engagement in online and virtual learning environments ( Standen  et al., 2020 ;   He et al., 2022 ;   Dehbozorgi and Kunuku, 2023 ).  Emotions play a crucial role in human interaction and decision-  making processes. EEG signals provide an accessible, inexpensive,  portable, and user-friendly means to identify emotions ( Alarcao and  Fonseca, 2017 ). This technology is highly valued for its real-time  analysis capabilities of emotional states. The portability and ease of use  of EEG devices make them particularly suitable for educational  applications, offering new possibilities for enhancing communication,  well-being, and decision-making at both individual and societal levels.  Transfer learning approaches, which utilize networks pretrained  on other tasks, have proven highly effective in facial emotion  recognition   within   human-computer   interaction,   achieving   an  impressive average accuracy of 96% ( Chowdary et al., 2023 ). This  method leverages the existing knowledge embedded in neural network  models to enhance the detection of emotional expressions in digital  settings. The high accuracy of these approaches lays a strong  foundation for developing advanced human-computer interaction  systems, which can enhance online learning experiences by providing  more accurate and nuanced emotional feedback.  Chao et al. (2019)   introduced a deep learning framework that  employs a multiband feature matrix and a CapsNet model to improve  emotion recognition from multi-channel EEG signals, outperforming  common models. This innovation underscores the importance of  advancing deep learning techniques to increase the accuracy and  efficiency   of   emotion   recognition   in   educational   settings.   By  integrating multiple EEG channels and utilizing the generalization  capabilities of CapsNet models, this framework sets a new standard  for   detecting   emotional   states,   significantly   impacting   our  understanding of emotions in academic performance and engagement  in online and virtual learning environments.  The novel deep learning model (ERDL), which combines graph  convolutional neural networks and LSTMs, has achieved superior  classification accuracy for emotion recognition from EEG signals  compared to current state-of-the-art methods ( Yin et al., 2021 ). This

Page 7:
Vistorte et al.   10.3389/fpsyg.2024.1387089  Frontiers in   Psychology   07   frontiersin.org  advancement underscores the effectiveness of integrating various  deep learning techniques to enhance emotional recognition in brain  signals. By combining the capability to model complex relationships  in graph-like data with the ability to handle temporal sequences  through LSTMs, the ERDL model emerges as a potent tool for  deciphering emotions via EEG signals. This improvement in  classification accuracy is crucial for designing more effective  educational   interventions   tailored   to   the   emotional   needs  of students.  Development began in 2014 of a technique using convolutional  neural networks that effectively learns emotion-relevant features from  speech, maintaining stable and robust performance even in complex  environments ( Mao et al., 2014 ). This study demonstrates the power  of convolutional neural networks in extracting distinct emotion-  related features from speech, enabling precise and reliable recognition  of emotional expressions across various settings. The consistent and  robust performance of this method supports its potential for practical  applications, including enhancing human-computer interaction in  virtual and online educational settings.  Furthermore, research indicates that students’ understanding of  emotions correlates positively with their academic performance, peer  acceptance, and school adaptation, especially among children from  middle-class families ( Voltmer and von Salisch, 2017 ). This finding  highlights the importance of emotional intelligence in the educational  and social contexts of students, influencing various aspects of their  development. The ability to understand and manage emotions not  only affects academic success but also enhances the quality of  interpersonal relationships and adaptability in school settings.  Additionally, the variation in these associations across different  socioeconomic backgrounds emphasizes the need for equitable  attention to emotional development within education.  3.2.2 Emotionally intelligent e-learning systems  and adaptive learning systems  Emotionally Intelligent E-learning Systems (EIES) and adaptive  learning systems are transforming learning experiences by providing  personalized educational environments ( Ninaus et al., 2019 ;   He et al.,  2022 ;   Dehbozorgi and Kunuku, 2023 ).  The Emotionally Intelligent E-Learning System (EIES), based on  the Bayesian Network model, accurately predicts students’ emotions  during online learning sessions, enhancing the quality of virtual  education ( Daouas and Lejmi, 2018 ). This innovation underscores the  importance of incorporating emotional intelligence into online  learning environments. By predicting emotions, EIES can dynamically  tailor the delivery of educational content, provide personalized  feedback, and offer emotional support resources when necessary. This  capability significantly enriches the online learning experience,  creating a more responsive and engaging educational environment.  Additionally,   it   has   been   demonstrated   that   artificial  intelligence techniques can enhance adaptive e-learning platforms  by creating detailed learner profiles and models, which in turn  improve the learning process and reduce uncertainty ( Colchester  et   al., 2017 ). This advancement highlights the crucial role of  artificial intelligence in personalizing online education by enabling  systems   to   adapt   dynamically   to   individual   learner   needs.  Advanced algorithms help these platforms identify specific learning  patterns, preferences, and challenges of each student, thereby  facilitating the delivery of relevant and effective educational  content. This adaptive capability significantly improves the learning  experience, fostering a more responsive and student-centered  educational environment.  A cloud-based adaptive learning system has proven effective in  integrating mobile devices into the classroom environment, providing  real-time feedback and context-aware content adaptation, leading to  significant improvements in student performance and achievement  ( Nedungadi and Raman, 2012 ).  This approach demonstrates the potential of mobile technology  and cloud computing to enhance the classroom learning experience  by offering greater flexibility and personalization of educational  content. By leveraging mobile devices like tablets or smartphones,  adaptive systems can deliver instant feedback and tailor content to  individual needs and learning contexts, thus boosting the overall  effectiveness of the educational process and encouraging student  participation and engagement.  Adaptive learning technologies, which tailor instruction to align  with students’ personal interests, have demonstrated the potential to  enhance performance and learning outcomes ( Walkington, 2013 ).  This finding emphasizes the importance of customizing educational  content to match individual preferences to optimize the learning  process. Adaptive algorithms analyze students’ learning patterns and  interests, allowing systems to present relevant content and challenges  that maintain their motivation and engagement. This personalized  approach   promotes   more   active   participation   and   a   deeper  understanding of the material, ultimately leading to improved  academic performance and more positive learning outcomes.  Personalized adaptive learning, facilitated by intelligent learning  environments, combines personalized and adaptive learning strategies,  making adaptive adjustments to teaching approaches based on  individual characteristics, performance, and personal development  ( Peng et al., 2019 ). This integration of educational methods offers a  comprehensive and effective solution tailored to the unique needs of  each learner. By merging personalized educational content with  dynamic   adaptations   in   teaching   methodology,   it   creates   an  educational environment that continually adjusts to the abilities,  interests, and preferences of students. This not only maximizes each  individual’s learning potential but also enhances engagement and  motivation toward the educational process.  In summary, the integration of Emotionally Intelligent E-Learning  Systems (EIES) and adaptive learning systems significantly enhances  the educational experience by providing personalized environments  that dynamically adapt to the emotional and learning needs of  students.   This   synergy   between   advanced   technologies   and  contemporary educational methodologies supports the accurate  prediction of students’ emotions during online learning sessions and  the   real-time   adaptation   of   content   and   teaching   strategies.  Collectively, these advancements underscore the transformative role  of technology in education, promoting more effective, inclusive, and  student-centered learning environments.  3.2.3 Positive emotional states and academic  performance  Positive emotional states correlate strongly with improved  academic performance and increased engagement in online learning  environments.   Students’   expressed   emotions,   such   as   relief,  satisfaction, and frustration, are directly linked to their academic  outcomes, illustrating the significant impact of emotions on learning

Vistorte et al.   10.3389/fpsyg.2024.1387089  Frontiers in   Psychology   08   frontiersin.org  results ( Ninaus et   al., 2019 ;   He et   al., 2022 ;   Dehbozorgi and  Kunuku, 2023 ).  Academic emotions, ranging from anxiety to other emotional  states, have a significant impact—both positive and negative—on  students’ motivation, learning strategies, self-regulation, and academic  performance ( Pekrun et al., 2017 ). This study illustrates how different  emotional states can affect various aspects of academic performance  and student engagement. Anxiety, for instance, can impede motivation  and self-regulation, while positive emotions can enhance learning  strategies and promote greater engagement with study materials.  Understanding the interaction between emotions and academic  performance underscores the importance of creating an educational  environment that promotes positive emotional states and provides  support to effectively manage negative emotions.  Moreover, students’ emotions, whether negative or positive,  significantly influence their academic performance, with cognitive  processes and effortful control playing a moderating role in this  relationship ( Valiente et al., 2012 ). This study highlights the complex  interplay between emotions and cognitive processes in the educational  context, noting how effortful control can modulate the impact of  emotions on academic performance. Positive emotions can enhance  performance by promoting greater motivation and engagement, while  negative emotions may hinder performance by interfering with  attention and memory. The role of effortful control suggests that  emotional and cognitive regulation strategies can mitigate the negative  effects of adverse emotions and amplify the benefits of positive  emotions on academic performance.  Positive emotions, such as enjoyment and pride, are positively  associated with mathematics achievement, while negative emotions,  such as anger, anxiety, shame, boredom, and hopelessness, have a  negative correlation ( Pekrun et   al., 2017 ). This emphasizes the  importance of emotions in the academic context and their differential  impact on student performance. Positive emotions can boost  motivation and readiness for learning, whereas negative emotions can  generate distractions and cognitive blocks. These findings highlight  the need to foster an educational environment that encourages  positive emotions and provides effective strategies to manage negative  emotions, aiming to improve both academic performance and student  well-being.  Positive emotions also promote academic performance in college  students when mediated by self-regulated learning and motivation  ( Mega et al., 2014 ). This study demonstrates that positive emotions  not only directly influence academic performance but also interact  with internal processes such as self-regulation of learning and  motivation to enhance educational outcomes. Positive emotions can  increase perseverance, attention, and the effectiveness of self-regulated  learning strategies, improving comprehension and retention of  academic material. Additionally, these emotions can reinforce  intrinsic motivation and disposition toward learning, leading to  deeper and more sustained engagement with the educational process.  Lastly, positive emotions positively influence problem-solving  patterns by engaging students in self-regulatory activities, whereas  negative emotions result in less variety of search activities and fewer  regulatory activities ( Zhou, 2013 ). This study shows how emotions can  shape the way students approach academic challenges and handle  complex problems. Positive emotions encourage active exploration,  creativity, and cognitive flexibility, leading to a wide range of problem-  solving   strategies   and   greater   solution-finding   effectiveness.  Conversely, negative emotions can restrict students’ ability to think  creatively and seek alternative solutions, resulting in less diversity in  problem-solving strategies and approaches. These findings underscore  the importance of promoting a positive emotional classroom  environment to foster the development of effective problem-solving  skills and self-regulation in students.  Positive   emotions   are   associated   with   higher   academic  performance as they enhance psychological capital, which includes  elements like efficacy, hope, optimism, and resilience ( Carmona-Halty  et al., 2019 ). This association supports the idea that positive emotional  states correlate with more effective cognitive processes, better  academic   outcomes,   and   greater   engagement   in   online  learning environments.  The emotional climate of the classroom also has a significant  impact   on   academic   achievement,   fostering   greater   student  participation across all grade levels and genders ( Reyes et al., 2012 ).  This supports the view that a positive emotional environment in the  classroom is crucial for academic success as it enhances student  engagement and involvement in the educational process, thereby  improving learning outcomes.  From a broader perspective, the TPACK framework emphasizes  the   effective   integration   of   technological,   pedagogical,   and  disciplinary content to enhance learning outcomes ( Alemán-  Saravia and Deroncele-Acosta, 2021 ). In this context, attention-  based convolutional recurrent neural networks (ACRNN) are  notable for their ability to accurately extract discriminative features  from EEG signals, improving emotion recognition over other  methods ( Tao et al., 2020 ). The integration of AI into educational  design   influences   learning   outcomes   directly,   increasing  motivation, self-efficacy, and the effectiveness of cognitive learning  strategies within learning communities ( Stefanou and Salisbury-  Glennon, 2002 ). Moreover, AI’s role in detecting students’ emotions  not   only   enhances   productivity   and   academic   performance  ( AlZu’bi et al., 2022 ) but also streamlines teaching practices by  allowing educators to monitor emotional states and provide  targeted feedback that positively affects learning outcomes ( Deniz  et al., 2019 ).  Additionally, AI can automate assessment-related decisions,  optimizing the effectiveness of computerized formative assessments  to enhance student learning ( Shin et al., 2022 ) and predict student  performance with high accuracy, enabling early interventions and  ensuring equitable quality education ( Jokhan et   al., 2022 ). AI  applications in education are diverse, including profiling, assessment,  adaptive systems, personalization, and intelligent tutoring systems  ( Zawacki-Richter et al., 2019 ).  Furthermore, course-related discussions and interactions among  students are shown to positively influence grades more than  non-course-related topics, underscoring the importance of emotional  engagement in learning.  Scientific evidence indicates that discussions within online  learning management systems can enhance student engagement,  improve the content and quality of work, and lead to better learning  outcomes ( King et   al., 2021 ). Aligning with this, another study  suggests that highly interactive online courses—marked by substantial  student-to-student   and   student-to-instructor   interactions—are  perceived more favorably in terms of engagement and learning  outcomes compared to less interactive group courses and discussions  ( Tsai et al., 2021 ). Additionally, peer discussions have been shown to

Page 9:
Vistorte et al.   10.3389/fpsyg.2024.1387089  Frontiers in   Psychology   09   frontiersin.org  enhance student performance on conceptual questions in class,  fostering greater understanding and improved accuracy, even when  none of the students initially know the correct answer ( Smith  et al., 2009 ).  Therefore, classroom interaction and discussion are crucial factors  for learning, and promoting these should be   a priority within  educational systems. The integration of AI can support this goal, as AI  techniques can effectively identify significant contributions and  patterns in students’ electronic discussions. This capability assists  teachers in fostering productive discussions and enhancing learning  ( McLaren et al., 2010 ). Furthermore, AI can also be utilized to develop  students’ skills in complex interpersonal behaviors, such as effective  listening,   teamwork,   and   communication   ( Hoffmann-Longtin  et al., 2018 ).  3.3 Special education and assistive  technology  Information and communication technologies (ICT) and assistive  technologies are vital for helping students, both with and without  disabilities, to recognize their emotions and enhance their learning.  These technologies are particularly crucial in removing barriers for  children   with   learning   difficulties.   Research   shows   that   ICT  applications can create inclusive learning environments and provide  essential support for students with learning challenges ( Standen et al.,  2020 ;   Begum et al., 2023 ).  Educators can utilize ICT and assistive technologies to customize  learning experiences based on the emotional needs of individual  students, thereby improving their engagement and overall learning  outcomes. The incorporation of these technologies not only aids in  emotion recognition but also establishes a supportive learning  environment that promotes both emotional well-being and academic  success for students with diverse learning needs ( Standen et al., 2020 ;  Begum et al., 2023 ).  For students with special needs, mobile learning provides greater  accessibility and richer learning experiences, presenting a valuable  alternative to traditional assistive devices. This mode of learning  enables students with diverse needs, including those with disabilities,  to engage in more adaptive and personalized learning ( Standen  et al., 2020 ).  By leveraging mobile technologies, educators can create inclusive  learning environments that cater to individual learning styles and  preferences, thereby enhancing student engagement and academic  outcomes. Mobile devices are portable and versatile, making learning  more accessible and convenient for students with special needs,  allowing them to interact with educational content in a manner that  best suits their specific requirements.  The   integration   of   mobile   learning   not   only   improves  accessibility but also enables students with special needs to  participate more actively in their learning process, fostering  independence and encouraging self-directed learning ( Standen  et al., 2020 ).  Overall, the strategic use of ICT and assistive technologies not  only facilitates the identification of emotions but also nurtures an  environment conducive to learning, supporting the emotional well-  being   and   academic   achievements   of   students   with   diverse  learning needs.  3.4 Affective computing  Affective computing is an interdisciplinary field that develops  systems capable of recognizing, interpreting, and responding to  human emotions.  This field of research has significant relevance in education  because emotions are critical to the learning process and to creating  meaningful educational experiences.  Understanding students’ emotions allows educators to tailor their  teaching methods to more effectively meet individual needs and foster  a positive and stimulating learning environment. In the context of our  research on integrating artificial intelligence to assess emotions in  learning environments, we investigate how advancements in affective  computing can enhance the assessment of students’ emotional  experiences and improve learning outcomes.  3.4.1 Affective computing as an area of AI in  emotional management  As explained by   Villegas-Ch et al. (2023) ,   affective computing is a  branch of Artificial Intelligence (AI) developed to enable computer  systems to interact with humans effectively. This interaction is  facilitated through computer vision techniques and machine learning  algorithms. The primary goal is to produce a system that can elicit  effective responses from users. Affective computing is interdisciplinary  and   consists   of   four   main   research   areas:   (1)   Analysis   and  characterization of affective states, (2) Automatic recognition of  affective states through facial expressions, linguistic features, posture,  gaze tracking, and heart rate, among others, (3) System adaptation to  respond appropriately to the users’ affective states, and (4) Design of  avatars   that   display   suitable   affective   responses   for   better  user interaction.  Emotion recognition via facial expressions, often referred to as  facial expression recognition, is a widely addressed topic within the  field of affective computing ( González-Hernández et al., 2018 ). By  recognizing facial expressions, educators can offer more personalized  responses, provide emotional support when needed, and promote a  more empathetic and student-centered learning environment. Thus,  the ability to recognize emotions through facial expressions is essential  for enhancing the quality and effectiveness of education.  3.4.2 Optimizing learning through affective  computing  The assertion that affective computing is essential to intelligent  learning systems is strongly supported by the growing recognition that  emotions are integral to cognitive and decision-making processes.  Research such as   Shobana and Kumar (2021)   demonstrates that  emotions significantly influence perception and learning. Integrating  affective computing into educational systems enables a more precise  and personalized response to students’ emotional needs, thereby  enhancing the effectiveness of the teaching and learning process.  Recognizing and responding to students’ emotions opens new  possibilities   for   creating   empathetic   and   effective   learning  environments, ultimately fostering deeper and more meaningful  learning experiences.  One of the key challenges of affective computing is the  automatic detection and classification of users’ emotional reactions  to learning materials ( Ninaus et al., 2019 ). This capability is crucial  in education for several reasons. Firstly, it allows educational

Page 3:
Vistorte et al.   10.3389/fpsyg.2024.1387089  Frontiers in   Psychology   03   frontiersin.org  binomial. This is expressed in the cognitive-affective unity of the  human personality. Intelligent tutoring systems are evolving to  address not only the cognitive aspect of learning, but also the  emotional   needs   of   students   to   improve   their   educational  experience and performance. In this sense, configurations are being  incorporated   that   enable   ITS   to   detect   emotions,   content  adaptation, emotional support, and personalized feedback, moving  toward an emotionally intelligent tutoring system ( Mohanan  et al., 2018 ).  A study involving “MetaTutor,” a hypermedia-based intelligent  tutoring system (ITS), showcases the capabilities of ITS to enhance  learning experiences. MetaTutor provides students with feedback on  the impact of positive and negative emotions during learning. It also  guides students on how to regulate specific emotions to optimize  learning effectiveness. Importantly, MetaTutor assesses not only  cognitive processes but also metacognitive processes, emphasizing its  comprehensive   approach   to   student   learning   and   emotional  management ( Taub et al., 2021 ).  A review study on emotion regulation in intelligent tutoring  systems   (ITS)   highlights   a   consensus   among   researchers   in  computerized learning. It suggests that ITS could greatly enhance  their effectiveness if they were able to adapt to the emotional states of  students.   This   adaptation   would   allow   ITS   to   better   support  personalized learning experiences by responding dynamically to the  emotional   and   cognitive   needs   of   each   student   ( Malekzadeh  et al., 2015 ).  There is a growing body of research linking intelligent tutoring  systems (ITS) to emotion during the learning process. Among the  most significant advances is the analysis of facial expressions to  estimate the emotional state of a student using ITS ( Sarrafzadeh et al.,  2003 ); the relationship between emotion variability, self-regulated  learning and task performance in ITS ( Li S. et al., 2021 ;   Li W.-C. et al.,  2021 ); inducing positive emotional states in ITS ( Chaffar et al., 2009 );  a new approach toward model students’ socio-emotional attributes to  predict their performance in ITS ( Assielou et al., 2021 ); the integration  of emotion management strategies in ITS ( Malekzadeh et al., 2014 );  emotional pedagogical agents in ITS ( Sun et al., 2013 ); the use of  emotional coping strategies in ITS ( Chaffar and Frasson, 2010 );  among many other results that clearly show that ITS have a close link  with human emotions.  2 Methods and procedures  We performed a systematic review of the scientific literature  through the following databases: Pubmed, Web of Science, PsycINFO  and Scopus. These articles were analyzed to extract key insights related  to the integration of AI and emotional assessment within educational  environments. Additionally, reference lists of included studies and  reviews were checked for potentially relevant articles not identified  through the electronic search.  The identification of thematic clusters was carried out through a  process of analysis and synthesis of the studies included in the review.  The criteria used were the following:  1   Thematic frequency : This criterion allowed us to identify the  frequency with which certain themes or concepts appeared in  the studies reviewed. This involved searching for and recording  patterns of key terms in the titles, abstracts, keywords and  sections of the studies reviewed.  2   AI technology used : This criterion is based on the specific  artificial intelligence technologies used in the studies reviewed.  It involves a detailed analysis of the techniques, tools,  algorithms   and   technological   approaches   used   for   the  evaluation of emotions in educational environments.  3   Domain or scope of application : This criterion focused on the  specific contexts in which artificial intelligence technologies  were applied to evaluate emotions in educational settings,  including special education. It examines whether the  studies   focused   on   particular   areas   such   as   general  education, vocational training or distance learning, as well  as   special   education   for   students   with   special  educational needs.  4   Results : This criterion allowed us to examine the findings of  each study, especially in relation to the relevant aspects for the  integration of artificial intelligence in the evaluation of  emotions in educational environments. The observed effects,  conclusions reached and implications for educational practice  were considered.  Once these criteria have been determined, we continue with the  process of identifying thematic clusters, following the following seven-  step procedure:  1   Study selection : We began with an exhaustive search of the  relevant literature using academic databases and specialized  search engines. Predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria  were applied to select relevant studies that addressed the topic  of integrating artificial intelligence to assess emotions in  educational settings.  2   Information extraction : Based on the established criteria, the  research team began the process of extracting key information  from each selected study, such as recurring concepts and  processes; Applied AI technology, intervention context, results  and main conclusions. This information provided a solid basis  for analysis and comparison between studies.  3   Identification of emerging themes : All the extracted information  was examined to identify recurring themes and organize  emerging patterns related to the integration of artificial  intelligence and the evaluation of emotions in educational  environments. This involved a rereading of each study with the  extracted information to understand its content and context.  4   Data Coding : Codes or labels were assigned to each emerging  theme or pattern.  5   Grouping into thematic clusters : Using the codes assigned to  each study or fragment, the codes were grouped into coherent  thematic clusters. This process involved identifying similarities  and   relationships   between   the   coded   information   and  organizing them into groups that address specific aspects of  integrating   artificial   intelligence   to   assess   emotions   in  educational settings.  6   Refinement and validation : Thematic clusters were reviewed  and refined to ensure consistency and relevance. Cross-  validation was carried out between the researchers involved in  the review to ensure accuracy and consistency in the grouping  of studies. At first, 9 clusters had been formed, however, this

Vistorte et al.   10.3389/fpsyg.2024.1387089  Frontiers in   Psychology   10   frontiersin.org  systems to adapt personally to the emotional needs of students,  enhancing the learning experience and fostering a more responsive  and empathetic environment. Additionally, it enables the early  identification of potential emotional difficulties that may impact  academic   performance,   allowing   for   timely  educational interventions.  There   are   online   learning   platforms   that   utilize   affective  computing principles to accurately identify six fundamental emotions:  happiness, disgust, anger, surprise, sadness, and fear ( Aly et al., 2023 ).  Recognizing and addressing this range of emotions allows educational  strategies to be   more contextualized and effective. For example,  detecting happiness can lead to the reinforcement of student  achievements, maintaining a motivating environment. Recognizing  disgust can help avoid content that triggers negative reactions, thus  enhancing the learning experience. By identifying anger, platforms  can provide additional support to help students overcome challenges  and stay motivated. Surprise can indicate moments of insight, which  can be leveraged to deepen understanding. Recognizing sadness is  essential for providing emotional support, while identifying fear can  signal the need for psychoeducational interventions to manage stress  and ensure effective learning. Overall, these capabilities facilitate a  more adaptive and emotionally-aware approach, promoting a more  inclusive and effective educational environment.  Research has extensively explored methods and models for affect  detection systems capable of analyzing conventional modalities such  as facial expression, voice, body language and posture, physiology,  brain imaging, and multimodal systems. This research connects  human emotions to learning, organizing them into four quadrants—  curiosity,   confusion,   frustration,   hope—with   emotions   on   the  horizontal axis and learning on the vertical axis ( Kort et al., 2001 ).  Affective computing offers multiple benefits when integrated with  artificial intelligence for emotion recognition. It has been shown to  enhance e-learning applications by detecting and responding to the  emotions of learners, potentially improving the learning process  ( Thompson and McGill, 2012 ). It can adjust the mood of learners to  create a more effective learning environment ( Chen and Lee, 2012 ),  recognize emotions from speech using neural networks ( Zhang et al.,  2007 ), monitor students’ behavior to gauge their attention and  engagement   levels,   and   support   effective   learning   processes  ( Bevilacqua et al., 2009 ). Additionally, it can boost motivation and  satisfaction in game-based adaptive learning systems ( Tsai et al.,  2012 ). In the context of game-based learning, one study shows that  adaptive   gamification—which   combines   artificial   intelligence,  gamification, and educational data mining—has a positive impact on  student   engagement   and   learning   performance   ( Daghestani  et al., 2020 ).  3.4.3 Advantages of affective computing as an  intelligent educational system  The primary aim of affective computing is to develop an  “intelligent” computer system capable of sensing, recognizing,  understanding, and intelligently responding to human emotions in a  timely and friendly manner ( He et al., 2022 ). Affective computing is  an   interdisciplinary   field   dedicated   to   creating   systems   and  technologies that can recognize, interpret, process, and respond to  human emotions. This field strives to equip machines with the  capability to comprehend and mimic human emotional intelligence,  utilizing a variety of data sources like facial expressions, tone of voice,  handwriting patterns, and other physiological indicators to ascertain  a person’s emotional state.  In educational settings, when integrated with artificial intelligence,  affective computing can personalize teaching by adapting content to  align with students’ emotions and individual needs ( Kratzwald et al.,  2018 ;   Marín-Morales et al., 2018 ,   2020 ;   Arnau-González et al., 2021 ;  Li S. et al., 2021 ;   Li W.-C. et al., 2021 ;   Wang et al., 2022 ). As such,  affective computing is a crucial element in the application of artificial  intelligence   in   emotional   management   within   educational  environments. It allows AI to interpret facial expressions, voice tones,  and other emotional cues, providing insights into students’ emotional  states. This capability not only facilitates the personalized adaptation  of educational content but also enables the early identification of  potential   emotional   challenges   that   may   impact   academic  performance. Overall, the integration of affective computing into  educational   emotional   management   not   only   enhances   the  effectiveness of learning environments but also supports the emotional  well-being of students, fostering a more supportive and responsive  educational setting.  Several advantages and contributions of affective computing are  recognized in recent research. For example, the Probability and  Integrated Learning (PIL) algorithm effectively recognizes high-level  human emotions, offering potential benefits for affective computing  ( Jiang et al., 2020 ). Additionally, fuzzy cognitive maps can accurately  predict artificial emotions, aiding in the design of affective decision-  making systems within AI ( Salmeron, 2012 ).  In the context of e-learning systems, affective computing involves  using tools to recognize users’ emotions and adapt educational  systems   accordingly   ( Jaques   and   Viccari,   2006 ).   It   has   been  demonstrated that affective computing can detect human attention  levels using multimodal inputs such as webcams and mouse  movements,   potentially   enhancing   performance   in   intelligent  e-learning applications ( Li et al., 2016 ).  Broadly speaking, affective computing is a field within artificial  intelligence that focuses on developing systems capable of recognizing,  interpreting, processing, and simulating human emotions. It employs  machine learning techniques, computer vision, natural language  processing, and other disciplines to analyze and respond to the emotions  expressed by users. The ultimate goal is to create systems that are more  empathetic and can interact more naturally with people. Particularly in  education, integrating affective computing is crucial for understanding  and addressing student emotions, promoting a learning environment  that is more personalized, effective, and attentive to emotional well-being.  4 Conclusion  The   integration   of   assistive   technology,   information   and  communication technology (ICT), and artificial intelligence (AI) in  educational settings has revolutionized the support available to  students, particularly those with learning difficulties, in managing  their learning and emotions. For children with diverse learning needs,  AI-enhanced emotion detection, personalized learning experiences  through ICT, and improved accessibility via assistive technology have  significantly reduced learning barriers.  This research highlights the critical role of technology in enhancing  emotion recognition, creating inclusive learning environments, and  promoting academic success for all children.
