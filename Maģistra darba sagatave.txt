Introduction
As education increasingly shifts online, maintaining learner motivation and engagement becomes a significant challenge, especially due to emotional disengagement. Traditional e-learning platforms lack the capacity to recognize or respond to learners' emotional states, leading to reduced effectiveness. Recent advancements in AI—including emotion recognition and NLP—promise to address these gaps by providing real-time, personalized emotional support. This paper aims to outline how AI can be effectively integrated into e-learning platforms to enhance motivation, engagement, and ultimately learning outcomes.
Object and Subject of the study: E-learning environment, Artificial Intelligence, Emotion recognition, Natural Language Processing.
The aim of the master’s thesis: Identify AI technologies for emotion recognition. Assess the impact of emotional personalization on learning performance and motivation. Discuss challenges and opportunities, such as ethical considerations and technical limitations, in implementing these systems.
Tasks defined to achieve the aim of the study: Review existing studies on AI-driven emotion recognition, NLP in education, and adaptive e-learning, and identify current gaps, best practices, and successful case studies.
1.	Identify and select AI tools relevant for e-learning integration, and evaluate tools based on defined criteria: accuracy, real-time capability, privacy, integration flexibility, and personalization. 
2.	Build an e-learning model with integrated AI emotion recognition and NLP tools, ensure the prototype can collect real-time learner data, process emotional cues, and adapt learning paths accordingly. 
3.	Conduct experiments involving real users interacting with the prototype, collect quantitative data (system metrics, engagement scores) and qualitative data (user feedback).
4.	Gather, process and analyze data from user interactions in compliance with GDPR and ethical standards. 
5.	Compare AI tool performance against the defined evaluation criteria, highlight best tools or approaches for e-learning integration.
6.	Summarize findings from benchmarking, prototype testing, and analysis, provide actionable guidelines for integrating AI emotion recognition into e-learning platforms.
7.	Produce deliverables including a literature review and benchmarking report, prototype module, anonymized dataset and evaluation scripts, methodology documentation, and integration guidelines.
Author’s proposed hypothesis / research question: How can Artificial Intelligence be effectively integrated into e-learning platforms to recognize and respond to learners’ emotional states, thereby improving engagement, motivation, and learning outcomes?
Research base: Riga Technical University
Research method: In this study five methods are used:
•	Literature Review: Identifies gaps, bets practices, and case studies in emotion recognition and adaptive e-learning.
•	Systematic Benchmarking: Evaluate AI tools by accuracy, real-time performance, privacy, integration, and personalization.
•	Prototype Development: Builds an e-learning model with integrated emotion recognition and NLP tools, collecting real-time learner data.
•	User Studies: Collects quantitative (accuracy, latency, outcomes) and qualitative (user feedback) data.
•	Comparative Analysis: Compares the performance of different AI tools and approaches.
Theoretical significance of the study: This study expands traditional theories of e-learning by incorporating the role of learner emotions. It contributes to educational psychology by empirically demonstrating that recognizing and responding to emotional states—such as stress, disengagement, or motivation—can significantly influence learning outcomes, retention, and engagement. The research bridges the gap between artificial intelligence and learning science. By applying emotion recognition and natural language processing (NLP) within educational settings, the study offers a theoretical framework for how AI can simulate empathy and adaptive teaching, thus enriching models of personalized learning. Classic e-learning models focused on content and instructional design. This study introduces a new paradigm where learning paths, feedback, and support are dynamically tailored using real-time emotional data, leading to more holistic, learner-centered theories of education. The study provides a structured methodology and set of evaluation criteria (accuracy, real-time processing, privacy, integration, adaptivity) that future researchers can use to assess and develop emotion-aware AI tools in education. This creates a theoretical foundation for further interdisciplinary research in AI-driven personalized education. By highlighting privacy, algorithmic bias, and the balance between automation and human interaction, the study contributes to the theoretical discourse on the ethical use of AI in education, guiding the responsible development of emotionally intelligent e-learning systems.
Practical significance of the study: By enabling e-learning platforms to recognize and respond to learners’ emotional states in real time, this study provides practical strategies for keeping students engaged. Emotional support powered by AI can reduce dropout rates, increase motivation, and lead to better knowledge retention. The research demonstrates how AI-driven emotion recognition and natural language processing (NLP) can dynamically adapt learning content, feedback, and pacing to each learner’s needs, abilities, and feelings—making education more effective and individually tailored. Implementing AI tools for emotional support allows educational institutions to offer high-quality, personalized support to large numbers of learners without the need for proportional increases in human staff. This scalability is especially valuable for organizations with limited resources. AI can help make learning materials and emotional support accessible to students with disabilities and those from diverse linguistic and cultural backgrounds, thereby fostering inclusive education. The integration of AI enables instant feedback on learner performance and emotional state, allowing timely interventions and support before issues escalate, improving overall learning outcomes. By collecting and analyzing emotional and engagement data, educators and administrators can identify at-risk students, improve instructional design, and target interventions more effectively. AI-driven platforms can be used for ongoing professional development and upskilling, adapting to the emotional and motivational needs of adult learners in corporate or continuing education contexts. The study provides actionable recommendations, benchmarks, and prototype tools that e-learning developers and institutions can use to integrate AI-powered emotional support into existing systems (e.g., Moodle, Ortus).
