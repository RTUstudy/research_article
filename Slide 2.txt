# Slide 2: Research Methods & Approaches

- Literature Review  
- Systematic Benchmarking  
- Experimental Prototype Development  
- Testing & User Studies  
- Comparative Analysis

---

**Speaking Text:**  
Our research starts with a comprehensive literature review to identify what has already been done in the field. We then benchmark AI tools based on defined criteria. Next, we develop an experimental prototype, conduct user studies, and finish with a comparative analysis to evaluate all tools and approaches.

# Slide 3: Literature Review & Benchmarking

- Identify gaps, best practices, and case studies  
- Benchmark AI tools for e-learning  
- Criteria: accuracy, real-time, privacy, integration, personalization

---

**Speaking Text:**  
The literature review helps us find gaps and best practices in emotion recognition and adaptive e-learning. After that, we systematically benchmark AI tools, evaluating them based on accuracy, real-time performance, privacy, integration flexibility, and personalization.

# Slide 4: Prototype Development & User Testing

- E-learning model with AI emotion & NLP tools  
- Real-time learner data collection  
- Adapts learning paths for personalization  
- User studies collect quantitative and qualitative data

---



**Speaking Text:**  
We develop a prototype integrating AI emotion recognition and NLP tools. The system collects real-time data from learners and adapts content to personalize their experience. User testing provides both quantitative results, like system metrics, and qualitative feedback from users.

# Slide 5: Research Data: Acquisition, Processing, Analysis

- Data from user interactions: emotions, engagement, outcomes  
- Processing: normalization, anonymization, feature extraction  
- Classification: face/video, text sentiment  
- GDPR and ethical compliance

---

**Speaking Text:**  
Data is gathered from user interactions within our system, including emotional reactions and engagement. We process the data through normalization, anonymization, and feature extraction, ensuring compliance with GDPR and ethical standards. The data is then classified using face/video and text analysis.

# Slide 6: Quantitative & Qualitative Analysis

- Quantitative:  
  - Emotion recognition accuracy  
  - Latency for real-time feedback  
  - Pre/post-test improvement  
- Qualitative:  
  - User feedback on adaptivity, privacy, usability

---

**Speaking Text:**  
Our analysis combines quantitative metrics, like accuracy and system latency, with qualitative insights from user feedback. This dual approach gives a complete picture of system performance and user satisfaction.

# Slide 7: Research Results & Deliverables

- Quantitative tool evaluation  
- Evidence of impact on engagement and outcomes  
- Comparative analysis of best approaches  
- Deliverables:  
  - Literature & benchmarking report  
  - Prototype module  
  - Anonymized dataset & evaluation scripts  
  - Final methodology & recommendations  
  - Integration guidelines
