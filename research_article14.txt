Like so many of the technologies that have changed the world, artificial intelligence (AI) developed over many years before it seemed to suddenly burst on the scene. Today, AI is ubiquitous and offers revolutionary potential for education.

With AI, educators can tailor learning experiences to individual student needs, making education more effective and engaging. AI-enabled technologies also assist in administrative tasks, streamlining operations and freeing up educators to focus on teaching. Learn more about how teachers and school administrators are using AI-powered tools today and the possibilities for the future of artificial intelligence in education.

A short history of AI systems development
The term "artificial intelligence" was actually coined in 1956. In that year, John McCarthy, a Dartmouth College professor, organized a pivotal workshop that coined the term "artificial intelligence" and aimed to create machines capable of reasoning and using human language.1

After a fast start, research interest in AI cooled for a few decades before developments in computer technology drove a resurgence in the 1990s with advances in machine learning and neural networks. The public release of Chat GPT in 2022 marked a significant milestone, showcasing unprecedented capabilities in natural language understanding and generation, and fueling further advancements in AI. Today, AI significantly impacts various sectors, from healthcare to finance, manufacturing, and transportation. Many think it is also poised to revolutionize education.2

Paving the way for AI tools in education
Computer-assisted instruction (CAI) began in the 1960s, presenting instructional material with expensive mainframe computers. As computer technology became smaller and more affordable, more schools were able to adopt CAI.

Intelligent tutoring systems emerged with the advent of desktop computers, offering tutorial programs that provided immediate feedback and tailored learning paths based on student responses. These systems demonstrated the potential benefits of personalized learning, making technology adoption in education increasingly attractive.3

Current applications of AI in education
AI is transforming K-12 education by offering innovative solutions in personalized learning, adaptive learning platforms, intelligent tutoring systems, automated grading and feedback, and administrative tasks.

Personalized learning
AI in education facilitates individualized learning by tailoring instructional content to individual student needs, benefiting students, teachers, and resource-constrained schools. This approach allows students to progress at their own pace, engage with activities aligned with their learning styles, and gain more autonomy over their educational journeys. Using AI assistants to differentiate assignments and devise data-driven, adaptive practices enhances the overall learning experience with minimal increase to the teacher's workload.4

Intelligent tutoring systems
AI tutor systems can provide adaptive, accessible learning experiences, offering immediate feedback and corrective guidance based on student performance. These applications of modern educational technology are helping to close learning gaps, improve conceptual understanding, and free up teacher time by handling routine instructional tasks and providing detailed data on the student's learning process.5, 6

Automated grading and feedback
Traditional grading for written work often involves subjectivity and biases, as teachers’ evaluations can be influenced by personal preferences, moods, and unconscious prejudices. This lack of objectivity can result in inconsistent and unfair assessments. Additionally, the time-consuming nature of grading large numbers of assignments limits teachers' capacity to provide thorough feedback, potentially hindering student learning.7

Integrating AI into the grading process is revolutionizing traditional approaches to evaluating student performance. AI can enhance grading efficiency, precision, and fairness by significantly reducing grading time and providing instant, detailed feedback. This allows teachers to assign more writing tasks and offer timely, constructive feedback, which fosters better writing skills in students.7

However, it's essential that teachers critically review AI-generated feedback to ensure it aligns with educational goals and addresses individual student needs. AI tools should be seen as assistants rather than replacements, helping teachers focus on assessing creativity and critical thinking while AI assists teachers with more objective metrics like grammar and structure. By staying engaged in the grading process and spot-checking AI output, teachers can maintain the integrity of assessments and ensure students receive meaningful and accurate feedback.8, 9

Administrative applications
Artificial intelligence tools can streamline lesson planning and content creation, saving teachers valuable time. These AI tools can generate high-quality images, customized content, and focused research materials under tight time constraints. By using AI for efficient research and content generation, teachers can enhance lesson quality without increasing their workload, ultimately benefiting both students and resource-constrained schools.10

School principals can also leverage AI technologies to reduce their substantial administrative burdens. AI chatbots assist with automating administrative tasks such as drafting emails, organizing schedules, and developing professional development sessions. AI models can be used to analyze large datasets to inform decision-making, like scheduling summer classes based on parent preferences. This allows administrators to focus more on strategic initiatives, human interaction and relationship-building.11
