Social-emotional learning (SEL) through the ability to develop skills in self- awareness,   self-management, social   awareness,   relationship   skills,   and responsible decision- making is necessary for students' overall development and well-being. Traditional approaches to SEL have mainly been using face-to-face communication, teacher-led discussions, and classroom activities. With the trend towards digital learning environments becoming stronger, it is important to know how AI-based tools can enable, enhance, and transform social-emotional learning processes. AI technologies, by natural language processing, affect detection, and predictive modeling, can potentially identify the emotional state of students, modify learning content, and give timely interventions that can serve their psychological and emotional needs, thus contributing to a more rounded learning experience (León, 2025).  Psychologically, embedding AI in SEL poses special opportunities and challenges. Emotional intelligence, a central pillar of SEL, has been linked for decades to academic achievement, mental health, and social relations. AI-based facial recognition technologies can detect facial expressions, patterns of speech, and behavioral indices that signal student stress, anxiety, or disengagement in real time, and enable teachers and counselors to intervene in a timely fashion. Apart from that, AI systems are also able to provide personalized feedback and coping skills based on emotional profiles, leading to the improvement of students' emotional regulation ability. This human-AI interactive dynamic simulation raises serious ethical concerns regarding data privacy, emotional manipulation, and human-AI sincerity, which must be addressed to create ethical and fair use. Here, with the advancement of technology in AI, it is important to achieve psychological impact on users to design systems that actually improve students' emotional and mental wellbeing without compromising on ethical demands (Popenici & Kerr, 2017).  Technologically, the integration of social-emotional learning with   AI requires sophisticated algorithms that can recognize subtle emotional cues and context-specific information. Advanced affective computing and machine learning have enabled AI systems to recognize and respond to users' emotional states more effectively. Virtual avatars and chatbots, for example, can provide empathic communication, and adaptive learning platforms adjust difficulty levels in content based on learners' emotional and cognitive involvement. These technologies not only increase the individualization of learning experiences but also enable social-emotional development through offering safe, judgment-free zones where students are able to open up about their feelings and receive support. However, making such AI systems contextually and culturally sensitive is essential, as expressions of emotion and their interpretation are varied across varying social and cultural contexts. This technology must be followed by interdisciplinarity among computer scientists, educators, and psychologists to design technically valid and socially acceptable AI- based SEL tools (Calvo & D'Mello, 2010).  Educationally, the incorporation of AI in SEL practice is revolutionary for both informal and formal education. As more schools embrace digital platforms, AI-powered SEL tools can help teachers   track   students'   emotional   health,   recognize   students   at   risk,   and   apply   targeted interventions. AI can also help create virtual SEL curricula, gamified learning modules, and interactive simulations to acquire empathy, cooperation, and conflict resolution. Through the use of AI to provide instant feedback and persistent progress tracking, instructors are able to design individualized learning paths that address not just academic development but also emotional development. This kind of integration speaks to the growing emphasis placed upon holistic education, where the worth of the cultivation of emotional intelligence alongside intellectual acumen is recognized as an integral factor in preparing students for the complexity of life today. In achieving this vision, teacher education and education policy must change to include AI literacy

The Critical Review of Social Sciences Studies, Volume 3, Number 2, 2025  812  and ethical guidelines, so that teachers can take advantage of the opportunities and challenges of AI-facilitated SEL (Luckin et al., 2016).  1.1 Psychological Perspective on AI-Integrated SEL  Psychologically, the integration of AI into social-emotional learning (SEL) holds bright promise and scary challenges. Emotional intelligence, in which one can perceive, understand, and control his or her own emotions as well as empathize with others, is of paramount importance in the general development, academic performance, and relationships of students. With the evolution of web-based   learning   platforms,   facial   expression-scanning,   tone-of-voice   analysis,   eye-gaze detection, and behavior monitoring technologies driven by artificial intelligence are increasingly becoming acceptable to monitor the emotional state of students in real-time. These systems can identify stress, anxiety, frustration, or disengagement cues and enable instructors and web-based learning platforms to provide timely and targeted emotional interventions. AI will also recommend coping strategies, recommend relaxation techniques, or tell users to practice relaxation skills for improved emotional regulation. AI provides new avenues for proactive mental health interventions and SEL in the classroom and online learning environments (Luckin et al., 2022).  In spite of these developments, the combination of psychology and AI in social-emotional learning is accompanied by considerable psychological and ethical issues. The most prominent of these issues is the validity of AI-driven empathy and emotional support. Whereas human emotional bonds are built on shared knowledge and real emotional attachment, AI instantiates empathy based on algorithmic programming and prediction analytics. This leads one to wonder if ever emotional interactions of a machine nature can satisfy the psychological needs of students or if they risk generating shallow relationships without actual human insight. Moreover, excessive dependence on AI to regulate and monitor students' emotions has the potential to rob students of face-to-face opportunities for actual social-emotional skill acquisition necessary for psychological development and resilience. Researchers contend that while AI can properly complement SEL, it must never entirely substitute for the rich, contextual nature of human emotional exchanges (Holmes et al., 2019).  Furthermore, integrating AI into social-emotional learning systems also brings with it crucial questions about emotional data privacy and psychological safety. AI-based SEL platforms rest on harvesting and processing sensitive personal data such as facial emotions, voice tone, text-based input, and behavior trends. While such systems are specifically designed for the advancement of emotional well-being, there is always a threat of abuse, misuse, or emotional profiling, which can lead to privacy intrusions and emotional distress. Keeping students' emotional data confidential and in ethical terms is critical in maintaining trust in AI-based education systems. Furthermore, students may also feel nervous or uncomfortable being monitored all the time by AI to identify their emotions, which would negatively impact their psychological well-being. As AI technologies continue to evolve, it becomes increasingly important that educational institutions and technology developers establish clear ethical standards and open data governance processes in place to provide the emotional privacy of students and foster responsible AI development and implementation within educational settings (Popenici, Stefan., 2023).  1.2 Technological and Educational Perspectives on AI-Integrated SEL  The use of artificial intelligence (AI) in social-emotional learning (SEL) is highly reliant on the continually expanding developments in affective computing, natural language processing, and machine learning technologies. AI technology has evolved beyond information processing to

Page 6:
The Critical Review of Social Sciences Studies, Volume 3, Number 2, 2025  815  education and virtual learning environments, the call for scalable, adaptable, and affectively sensitive learning tools has been more and more pressing, and what is urgently needed are sophisticated technological interventions capable of responding adequately to evolving emotional and social needs of learners.  To   address   this   demand,   scholars   have   already   begun   exploring   the   possibilities   of   AI complementing SEL through the incorporation of affective computing, emotion recognition systems, and adaptive learning software into classrooms. (Luckin, Rose, et al.2022) recognized the growing need for education to incorporate AI-based tools in supporting both cognitive and affective dimensions of learning, particularly in online classroom environments with minimal human interaction. Recent breakthroughs in machine learning, natural language processing, and computer vision have empowered AI systems to recognize facial expressions, tone of voice, body language, and text-based emotional indicators, and gain deep insights into students' emotional states. Researchers such as (Booth, B 2023) have shown how such progress in affective computing enables AI to offer individualized emotional support as well as adjust teaching materials according to the cognitive and affective engagement levels of learners.This ability not only promotes personalized learning but also the acquisition of vital social-emotional skills, such as empathy, regulation of emotions, and making decisions. Still, while such innovations hold their tremendous potential, additional extensive studies are needed to consider their psychological effect, their ethics, and applicability in varied education systems.  While significant progress has since been achieved in AI-based SEL studies, previous research is known to constrain the scope of their inquiry on the technological capability of AI without fully exploring the broader psychological, cultural, and educational challenges that come with their application. Problems surrounding data privacy, emotional genuineness, cultural adaptability, and over-reliance on AI systems to provide emotional support still persist. As more scope for human affective interaction-like capabilities is made available by AI, doubts are being raised regarding the validity of empathic responses from machines and how they can influence students' learning in emotion. It is also possible that there will be cross-cultural variations in emotional expression and interpretation that would influence the validity and suitability of emotional feedback provided by AI, necessitating culturally responsive designs for such systems. Few studies have even talked about these issues or proposed interdisciplinary models to ensure effective, responsible, and ethical application of AI in SEL. Luckin et al. (2016) observed that to be effective, AI for education must incorporate psychological and cultural dimensions, developing inclusive, emotionally safe, and ethically robust digital learning environments. This synthesis of literature, therefore, tries to fill this gap by synthesizing new research in AI-based SEL, examining current gaps in current literature, and speculating on how the complementary inputs of teachers, psychologists, and technologists can be harnessed towards developing context-sensitive, emotionally intelligent, and accessible AI-based learning devices for today's learning settings. In addition to analyzing the cultural and ethical dimensions, recent studies have also recognized the necessity of studying the long-term psychological effects of prolonged exposure to emotionally intelligent AI.  While affective computing technologies have been generating promising results in enhancing learners' motivation and emotional concern in experimentally controlled short-term learning conditions, their wider application remains questionable with respect to potential dependencies, change in the process of emotional processing, and changes in students' social relationships in real life (Popenici & Kerr, 2017). For example, exposure over a long period to AI-emulating empathy could impact students' ability to maneuver intricate human feelings in offline social encounters or set unrealistically high standards for emotional availability within human relationships. Research scholars   therefore   call   for   longitudinal,   cross-disciplinary   research   that   investigates   the

The Critical Review of Social Sciences Studies, Volume 3, Number 2, 2025  817  ultimately encourage contributing to the social-emotional learning of the students Holmes et al. (2024).  2.2 AI-Driven Social-Emotional Learning: Technological and Educational Implications  Technological advancements have come to serve as a key propelling agent to the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in social-emotional learning (SEL). The ability of AI systems to detect and interpret emotional cues from multimodal data analysis has immensely opened the window to personalized emotional assistance in learning spaces. With natural language processing, machine learning, and computer vision growing rapidly, current AI technologies can recognize a wide range of emotional states in real-time from the facial expressions of students, voice tone, and even behavioral patterns. This ability enables AI systems to tailor student learning experiences with their emotional response, which is enhancing the personalizability of learning content. For instance, affect-sensitive AI chatbots can adjust their conversation tone or switch the presentation of learning materials based on learners' emotional involvement in a way that learners get a more sensitive and compassionate learning experience. These adaptive and   dynamic systems   are especially advantageous for learners who might struggle with conventional learning settings, providing them with a more empathetic and emotionally intelligent form of interaction (Calvo & D'Mello, 2010).  Apart from chatbots, AI technologies have also been integrated into gamification sites and virtual reality (VR) to extend the scope of SEL. Virtual reality allows learners to have agency over being transported to virtual social environments where they can practice such key skills as empathy, conflict management, and decision-making within emotionally rich environments. Virtual reality interactions, driven by the application of AI, make it possible for a secure and controlled platform upon which students may be accessed and educated through deeper emotions without putting their safety at risk through genuine, life-simulating occurrences. AI imitation can offer scenarios where students are presented with emotional challenges like peer conflict resolution or group work and receive instant responses to their actions.  These technologies bring depth, an experiential model of SEL, to reinforce classroom instruction and provide new pathways for students to build emotional intelligence in engaging, interactive environments. Through the incorporation of game mechanics, the sites enable the achievement of more motivation and engagement from students, providing an engaging context in which social- emotional skill development and emotional resilience can flourish.  Educationally, the integration of AI into SEL is a shining opportunity for improving schools in student well-being, especially through electronic and blended-up learning systems. With the schooling system more and more coming under online portals, AI-based SEL systems can potentially provide immensely valuable assistance to teachers by tracking in real-time what children are feeling and perceiving as human beings. These tools allow instructors to track students' emotional investment, detect warning signs of stress, anxiety, or disengagement, and react before these problems escalate.For instance, AI systems can track how students engage in online classrooms and record emotional cues that then guide teachers on which students should be provided extra emotional support. Such ability enables students who fall through gaps of other conventional learning institutions to have their emotional needs addressed immediately. By enhancing   the   affective   dimension   of   learning,   AI   has   the   potential   to   enhance   academic achievement and social conduct and provide support by Durlak et al. (2011) that SEL is critical in developing successful, well-adjusted students.

The Critical Review of Social Sciences Studies, Volume 3, Number 2, 2025  821  The demographic distribution of the survey's 271 participants shows a fairly equal gender split, with 52.8% male and 46.1% female participants, with 1.1% specifying other. The majority of participants were aged 31 – 40 years (38.4%), then 41 – 50 years (26.6%), indicating predominance of middle-age teachers in the sample. With regard to teaching experience, most of the participants were in the 6 – 10 years category (35.8%), with a great number also in the 1 – 5 years (31.7%) category, with a combination of early-career and old teachers. In terms of designation, Lecturers made up the highest percentage (43.9%), with Assistant Professors (31.0%), and Professors making up the lowest proportion (8.5%). Finally, on respondents by type of university, it seemed the largest majority were from public universities (64.9%), and 35.1% represented the private, indicating a broader coverage of teachers from the government.

The Critical Review of Social Sciences Studies, Volume 3, Number 2, 2025  822  The test of correlation reveals a positive moderate relationship between AI Integration (AI) and Emotional Well-being (EWB) with a correlation coefficient of 0.65. The test indicates that there will be an increase in the emotional well-being of university instructors as there will be an increase in the usage of AI-based social-emotional learning tools. The p-value (**) must be less than 0.05 and is revealed to be statistically significant for the given correlation. This discovery suggests that teachers' incorporation of AI technology into the classroom can be beneficial to their emotional well-being, and that AI-powered SEL technology can make emotional wellness achievable in school environments. Correlation does not always equal causation, and more research would be required to ascertain the exact nature of this correlation.

The unstandardized coefficient (B = 0.580) indicates that as one unit of AI integration increases, Academic Performance also goes up by 0.580 units. The standardized coefficient (Beta = 0.670) indicates a very high positive impact of AI tools on Academic Performance. t-value for the use of AI is 8.92 with p-value 0.000 much lower than the standard threshold value of 0.05 and, hence, concludes that indeed there does exist such a relationship   with   statistical   significance. The intercept   1.850   also   reflects   the   academically predicted performance when the incorporation rate with AI is zero. Overall, these findings are consistent with Hypothesis H2 and suggest that social-emotional learning resources facilitated by AI have positive and significant impacts on the educational outcomes of the targeted population.

This finding confirms that there exist huge differences in emotional well-being based on the level of AI integration within schools. That is, various levels of AI-based SEL tools have a drastically differential impact on the emotional well-being of university instructors in Punjab, confirming Hypothesis H3.  5.0 Discussion  The objective of the current research was to assess the role contributed by AI-facilitated social- emotional learning (SEL) tools towards improving student outcomes in terms of emotional well- being, incorporation of AI, and the relationship between these and teaching experience and university type. The results present meaningful insights regarding the incorporation of AI in education to offer emotional development alongside academic achievement.  Correlation analysis revealed that there was a moderate positive correlation between AI integration (AI) and emotional well-being (EWB) with a correlation coefficient of 0.65 (p < 0.01). This indicates that as the AI integration in schools increases, the emotional well-being of the students increases. The findings are in line with earlier studies that report the positive effect of AI-based interventions on emotional regulation and support (Calvo & D'Mello, 2010). AI technologies like emotion-aware chatbots and personalized feedback mechanisms provide real-time support to learners and build emotional resilience and improve social-emotional capability.

This link highlights the necessity of introducing AI-based tools for creating emotionally supportive learning environments for learning and personal growth.  The test of Hypothesis H2 for predicting the relationship between AI integration and emotional well-being   was   undertaken   through   regression.   A   significant   and   positive   influence   of   AI integration (B = 0.580, p < 0.01) was determined, demonstrating that AI tools are an integral contributor towards emotional well-being. This is in line with findings by studies like Luckin et al. (2016), where it is highlighted that using AI within learning environments has the potential to enhance learners' emotional regulation and resilience. The findings of this study show that AI systems are effective in providing learners with personalized emotional support interventions, and these can prove useful to teachers of various levels of experience. More seasoned instructors would welcome AI uses in facilitating classroom interactions and establishing an emotionally safe classroom space for the students. However, even novice teachers can be assisted by AI uses, as the software can assist with emotional problems that might be less within their capabilities. This opens up the possibility of AI-based systems to cover gaps in emotional support regardless of teacher experience.  Hypothesis H3 was tested by ANOVA, which contrasted emotional well-being between groups by type of university (public and private) and indicated that there was a significant difference between the groups (F = 9.85, p < 0.01). Significantly greater emotional well-being was reported by teachers in public universities compared to private universities. This may be explained by differences in institutional support, teaching facilities, and organizational climate between public and private universities. Public universities in Punjab, being older and larger, can perhaps have easier access to professional development courses, such as emotional well-being courses. Private universities might not have as much to offer, and this could impact the emotional support that can be provided to teachers. These findings underscore the importance of institutions, particularly private institutions, to invest in AI-driven emotional support systems to address the emotional well-being of their teachers, who in turn would be able to positively impact students' emotional and academic success.  At a more general level, the study's research reaffirms the social-emotional learning potential of AI. By incorporating AI tools into classrooms, schools are able to build more affect-aware and personalized learning environments. AI systems' capability to monitor students' affective states and implement targeted interventions can aid students in acquiring valuable emotional intelligence skills like self-regulation, empathy, and social awareness. In addition, AI technologies will assist educators in classroom management, identifying early warning signs of emotional distress and intervening at the appropriate time to prevent or moderate emotional difficulties. But the study also raises certain grave ethical issues. Existence of AI in emotional support raises questions regarding artificiality of empathy created by machines and danger of dependency on AI in the context of emotional support. Even as AI-based systems advance to be able to better mimic human emotions, of most importance is the fact that such systems enhance and augment, but do not destroy, true human interaction and human empathy within classroom settings. It is imperative that AI tools are developed following ethical standards so that their prime concern is the emotional welfare of the students and they also protect their privacy and welfare.  Although the research is rich in information, it does come with several limitations that need to be taken into account by future research. For one, it makes use of self-reported data, which can be prone to biases like social desirability or low-quality self-reports. Future studies can utilize mixed- method strategies, for example, interviews or focus groups, to gain deeper insights into teachers'

This advancement allows AI-based learning platforms to identify, understand, and respond to the emotional state of students more sensitively, adjusting teaching methods, conversation flows, and learning materials in real time. Technologies like empathetic chatbots, virtual learning buddies, and adaptive learning software offer personalized, emotionally sensitive learning experiences that enhance self-awareness, empathy, and relationship-building abilities. But for them to be effective, these technologies must be attuned to the immense range of the ways people feel and comprehend emotions across socio-economic groups and cultures. Otherwise, AI systems   may   misinterpret   emotional   cues   and   offer   insensitive   responses   or   ineffective interventions. Interdisciplinary cooperation between psychologists, educators, and technologists is therefore required to design emotionally intelligent, ethically grounded, and contextually sensitive AI-based SEL tools ( D’Mello,   S. K. 2021)  From a teaching perspective, integration of AI with SEL has an unparalleled potential to disrupt conventional classrooms along with online classrooms. While new models of blended and online learning are gaining acceptance globally, AI-based SEL interventions provide instructors with critical   support   to   track   students'   emotional   well-being,   recognize   the   symptoms   of   stress, disengagement, or emotional anguish, and intervene accordingly. Apart from surveillance and monitoring, AI also facilitates the production of efficient, interactive SEL content such as gamified assignments, virtual role-playing exercises, and social simulations meant to promote students' empathy, cooperation, emotional regulation, and decision-making skills. Besides, the ability of AI systems to track emotional development over time allows teachers to have more knowledge- informed insights into the social-emotional development of the students, hence they can develop tailored learning paths that address both cognitive and emotional development objectives. This customized model is aligned with the existing education goals that are aimed towards the overall growth   of   students   —   not   only   enhancing   their   mental   abilities   but   also   their   emotional intelligence, coping capacity, and interpersonal skills necessary to cope with the challenges of the new age (Luckin et al., 2024).  Even as these are potential opportunities, AI in schools also creates actual challenges to teacher preparedness, work in ethical uses, and fair access. Creating it into a reality will take commitment from schools and schools of education to invest in AI literacy professional development programs, ongoing   professional   development   through   life-long   career   progression   for   teachers,   and infrastructure systems for ethical work through AI in affectively safe environments like SEL. Teachers have to be highly competent not only to handle such technologies but also to understand how to utilize the AI-centric emotional intelligence to other social, cultural, and psychological spaces of students. In addition, privacy of emotional data, consent, and risk of emotional profiling or unconscious bias need to be met by full policies and open practices. Without control, AI systems for SEL could inadvertently perpetuate stereotypes or mislabel emotions, resulting in poorly fitting interventions or discriminatory practice. Thus, making sure that AI is implemented in SEL responsibly, inclusively, and equitably requires an equally fine-tuned collaboration among teachers, tech developers, psychologists, and policymakers to guarantee that students' emotional well-being is not jeopardized while reaping the maximum educational values these tools have to provide .(Holmes, W.2020).  1.3 Research Objectives  1.   To examine the role of artificial intelligence in enhancing social-emotional learning through emotion recognition and personalized feedback in educational settings.

The Critical Review of Social Sciences Studies, Volume 3, Number 2, 2025  814  2.   To explore the psychological, technological, and educational implications of integrating AI-based tools fr supporting students' emotional well-being and interpersonal skills.  3.   To identify the ethical challenges and practical considerations in implementing AI-driven social-emotional learning tools within classroom and virtual learning environments.  1.4 Problem Statement  With the rapidly fast-changing world of learning today, there is increasingly more recognized value to social-emotional learning (SEL) in fostering students' personal, social, and academic growth. However, conventional methods of implementing SEL fail to meet the different emotional needs   of students,   especially in   distance   and   online education   environments where   human interaction is pared to the bare essentials. With the emergence of artificial intelligence (AI), SEL may be supplemented with emotion recognition, adaptive feedback, and learning experiences tailored to individual learners. Beyond the kinds of technological capabilities, little has been studied about how AI-enhanced tools best and morally can be incorporated into educational systems to improve students' emotional welfare, social competence, and psychological growth. Additionally, issues of data privacy, emotional genuineness, and cultural awareness are left unaddressed. This study aims to address this by exploring the psychological, technological, and pedagogical   aspects   of   incorporating   AI   in   social-emotional   learning,   both   its   merits   and drawbacks under the modern education system.  1.5 Significance of the Study  This study is of utmost significance to policymakers, teachers, technologists, and psychologists since it provides a holistic picture of how AI can be utilized in a manner that can drive social- emotional learning into the contemporary education environment. In its examination of AI-driven SEL's psychological, educational, and technological aspects, the study will present real-life evidence on the development of emotionally intelligent learning systems that can instill empathy, emotional   self-management,   and   appropriately   adjusted   interpersonal   relationships   among students. In addition, the study will determine the ethical concerns and deployment concerns of using AI in emotional data collection and personalized emotional support. The findings will be a valuable contribution to the construction of responsible, inclusive, and culture-sensitive AI- enabled pedagogical content and guide educational institutions on how to use emotionally stimulating and psychologically safe learning environments   in   physical   schools   and virtual classrooms.  2.0 Literature Review  Artificial intelligence (AI) in education has been the subject of vast interest in the last several years, with teachers, academics, and policymakers eager to anticipate how it might reform traditional pedagogies. Ed-techs underpinned by AI have transformed from simplistic automated and content systems to sophisticated support systems that help in facilitating adaptive learning, clever tutoring, and real-time feedback. Among the emerging strategies, leveraging AI to enable social-emotional learning (SEL) is an impressive advancement, providing new pathways for developing students' emotional intelligence, social relationships, and mental well-being. Previous research   had   invariably   established   that   SEL   was   a   fundamental   ingredient   of   students' development leading to academic achievement, emotional adaptation, and competence to establish suitable interpersonal relationships (Durlak et al., 2011). Conventionally, SEL was taught in the classroom by applying activities carried out under teachers' instruction, peer-centered collaborative projects, and experience-based learning activities. But with the growing phenomenon of online

The Critical Review of Social Sciences Studies, Volume 3, Number 2, 2025  816  developmental and affective impacts of AI-assisted SEL tools over time and across cultures. Such studies would inform ethical design and deployment in actual settings of these technologies in a way that neither undermines students' social and emotional capacities in more digitized learning settings nor, alternatively, enhances them.  2.1 Psychological Perspective on AI-Integrated Social-Emotional Learning  The   integration   of   social-emotional   learning   (SEL)   and   artificial   intelligence   (AI)   presents educators with new means of facilitating the emotional development of students in academic environments. Emotional intelligence, consisting of self-perception, controlling one's feelings, empathy, and social ability, is acknowledged across the sector as a signifier of the overall development of students, achievement, and psychological well-being (Durlak et al., 2011). AI technologies, used via platforms like affective computing, seek to improve these abilities through the detection and reaction to emotional signals in real-time. AI systems capable of emotion detection can examine facial expressions, vocal patterns, and behavior, providing students with feedback that is personalized in nature if they are showing signs of disengagement, anxiety, or stress . Such ability to provide individualized emotional support enables AI to cater to individual students' emotional needs and contribute toward building a responsive and individualized learning environment. Additionally, AI systems can recommend mindfulness training, coping techniques, or social-emotional skills training exercises to impart emotional resilience and self-regulation for challenged students within traditional learning settings.  Even though the future of AI-based SEL tools is rosy, there are prevalent psychological concerns with implementing them in schools. The simplest concern is whether or not machine-empathy is genuine emotional support. Even though AI can simulate empathy and deliver the appropriate type of emotional response, questions are being asked about the effectiveness of machine-empathy in creating real emotional connection. With computer programs further developing to simulate human-like interaction, the probability of students choosing artificial emotional support over real interpersonal relationships grows in consideration (Popenici and Kerr (2017) advise that this kind of over-reliance on AI to control emotions may hinder the development of authentic human empathy and, arguably, reconstruct student engagement and interactions with emotions in a day-to- day context. AI software thus needs to be developed in a manner that they function as an extension of rather than a replacement for supportive emotional experiences which are attainable through teachers, friends, and family members. The significance of an ethical approach to the incorporation of AI into SEL with   human emotional relationships centered   at   its core is   paramount   in guaranteeing the authenticity of emotional development.  Besides challenges of emotional validity, SEL's use of AI also has grave ethical issues concerning handling sensitive emotional data. As AI systems contain and evaluate the emotional responses of students, privacy becomes a major consideration, especially in children. Unjustified use or access of individual emotional data invades the privacy and well-being of students. Developers and schools must have formed well-crafted ethical principles for using AI in SEL to guarantee the safeguarding and proper use of students' emotional data. Second, cultural sensitivity should be applied   when   designing   AI-based   emotional   support   systems.   Emotional   expression   and interpretation can be so diverse across cultures, and AI systems must be made to identify and respond to such diversity. A culturally responsive approach to the use of AI in SEL ensures that learners of all backgrounds are provided with emotionally intelligent support which is respectful and responsive to their differences. The convergence of ethics, privacy, and cultural sensitivity provides the foundation to necessitate a multi-disciplinary collaborative effort in an attempt to create AI applications as much a technical success as an emotional one as well so that they

The Critical Review of Social Sciences Studies, Volume 3, Number 2, 2025  818  In   addition   to   supporting   teachers   in   monitoring   emotional   well-being,   AI   could   enhance instruction in SEL by creating engaging and interactive content that complements students' social and   emotional   development.   AI-based   platforms   can   offer   adaptive,   game-like   learning experiences like virtual role-playing, simulated social interactions, and decision-making exercises that teach critical SEL competencies such as empathy, conflict resolution, and cooperation. These technologies can be used to adapt to track the cognitive interest levels and affect levels of students and thus design responsive and specific learning activities. For instance, an angry student would undergo a role-play activity on controlling emotions whereas another student would undergo an empathy-building activity meant to enhance their social awareness. Through the application of AI's versatility, such platforms build in-depth, dynamic SEL experiences that allow active engagement and skill mastery. Further, AI systems are able to observe and measure students' emotional progress over a long period of time, allowing teachers to build tailored learning trajectories that address educational as well as emotional needs, and offer a more holistic educational method Lima et al. (2024)  2.3 Research Hypotheses  1.   There   is   a   significant   effect   of   AI-based   social-emotional   learning tools   on   students' emotional intelligence.  2.   There is a positive relationship between the use of AI-driven SEL tools and improved academic achievement in digital learning environments.  3.   There is a significant difference in students' emotional well-being outcomes based on the cultural sensitivity of AI-driven SEL interventions.  3.0   Methodology  3.1   Research Design  The study's research design is quantitative, and its primary focus is on collecting and analyzing numeric data to understand the interdependence between various variables. A quantitative method is best applied in studying the impact of AI-based SEL tools on learning outcomes such as emotional   well-being   and   learning   performance.   This   approach   allows   for   systematic   data collection from a sample of Punjab university lecturers to enable researchers to ascertain statistical trends, patterns, and relationships between the utilization of AI-based tools and their implications on students' emotional and academic development. Quantitative data analysis has the potential to use statistical techniques with the aim of objective and generalizable inference. Quantitative design also makes it possible to easily ascertain cause-and-effect relationships by utilizing different measuring devices that can quantify dimensions of emotional intelligence, school involvement, and school achievement. Usage of this process by the research will provide rigorous investigation of process to which machine learning can renovate school social-emotional practice learning to some empirical context of its impact.  3.2   Population  The target population for this research are Punjab university teachers who form the pillar of teaching tradition and have been assigned to enable learning instruments within classrooms. Target population selected in this study were university teachers as they come in direct contact with students, exert direct influence over their learning levels, and tend to be facilitators of fresh tools such as those enabled by AI. Since the aim of this study is to explore the contribution made by AI towards social-emotional learning, university instructors are the most suitable candidates to

Page 10:
The Critical Review of Social Sciences Studies, Volume 3, Number 2, 2025  819  determine the usability, efficacy, and difficulties of applying such a tool within the context of a higher education institution. Also, the instructors have direct access to students' social and academic requirements and are therefore key informants through which to understand the broader educational effects of AI-powered SEL tools. This category is also diverse as the instructors in various subjects could encounter varying issues and opportunities in implementing technology within classrooms. Through an emphasis on Punjab university educators, the study is then able to examine how local, cultural, and educational environments influence the implementation of AI in order to facilitate social-emotional learning.  3.3   Sample Size  Sample size for the study is 271 respondents, which is enough to obtain statistically significant results and confirm and establish the reliability of the findings. The sample size is adequate to explore   the   relationship   between   AI-based   social-emotional   learning   tools   and   teaching performance among Punjab university instructors. By selecting an appropriate sample size, the study aims to limit the possibility of sampling errors and ensure that it becomes possible to generalize the results to the remaining universities' teachers population of the region. Sample size also gives statistical power to ascertain important differences or correlations in the data, with added overall dependability of study findings. There being a higher sample, a better subgroup analysis is possible as well, i.e., an easier comparison among different academic divisions or institution types by teachers. With 271 participants, there is a representative and diverse sample, and the results can be generalized to a broad array of education settings and environments.  3.4 Sampling Technique  For purposes of this research, the sampling method used is random sampling, which provides an opportunity for all members of the target group to have an equal opportunity of selection. Random sampling is used to reduce bias in choosing participants and ensure the selected sample is representative of the whole population of Punjab university teachers. Through this strategy, the research hopes to gain a variety of participants with the diversity of the larger population reflected in them, such as educators working in different fields of academia, degrees of teaching experience, and institutional affiliations. This assists in improving the external validity of the study because results can now be used in a larger context than the sample. Random sampling also allows one to make objective and unbiased decisions, and thus the results are more trustworthy as well as reduce the possibility of selection bias. This procedure is particularly vital when research into the performance of AI-based tools in learning contexts is carried out because it renders the findings based on such research unbiased by intrinsic difference among participants. Random sampling process is hence critical to study findings validity and hence their generalizability to the target group as a whole.  3.5 Ethical Considerations  The most important issue of this study in the current context is ethics, specifically one relating to obtaining data from the teachers at the university level in Punjab. For the purpose of ethical justification for the study, respondents will be clearly informed about the aims of the study, the element   of   voluntariness,   and   their   freedom   to   withdrawal   at   any   moment   without   any implications. Informed consent will be sought from participants with the guarantee that they will be told how their data   will   be stored and processed. Additionally,   confidentiality will   be maintained strictly, and all sensitive and personal information will be anonymized to prevent compromising participants' privacy. With regard to the psychological and emotional effects that

Page 11:
The Critical Review of Social Sciences Studies, Volume 3, Number 2, 2025  820  can result from AI-based tools used in learning, further caution will be exercised to tackle any issues with emotional health and data protection. The research will follow ethical guidelines set by respective academic institutions and ethical review committees to ensure all processes meet the standards of responsible research practice. The research will also be undertaken in a culturally sensitive manner to ensure the AI tools and methods employed are respectful and suitable for varied contexts.  4.0 Data Analysis  For the purpose of data analysis, the research will utilize some statistics techniques to analyze the relationship between the variables and test the effect of the AI social-emotional learning tools. To initiate the analysis, it will utilize correlation analysis to see the degree of association between the vital variables such as emotional well-being, school performance, and utilization of AI tools. Regression will be used to determine the predictive power of AI integration to varied outcomes, which will then be utilized to monitor causal patterns as well as the extent to which AI-driven SEL impacts academic and emotional performance. Second, ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) will be utilized to compare group differences on demographic measures like instruction experience or discipline department in attempting to further determine how such measures might influence the application and impacts of AI-enhanced SEL tools. These statistical analyses will all enable the study to make strong conclusions about the effectiveness and impacts of AI to enhance social- emotional learning among university students.

Moreover, the research was concentrated on Punjab university instructors, making findings applicable only to other regions or educational levels. It would be wonderful if future research would increase the sample size to include other regions,   levels   of   education   (e.g.,   primary   or   secondary   schools),   and   various   cultural environments to determine the generalizability of AI for SEL to different education systems.  5.1 Conclusion  In conclusion, this study constitutes robust evidence that social-emotional learning technology grounded in AI can promote emotional well-being, enhance academic performance, and aid instructors in meeting students' emotional needs. By offering customized emotional care, AI will transform the education sector and contribute to holistic student growth. Ethical issues and the need for culturally sensitive designs should, however, guide school implementation of AI. Further research is needed to advance AI-based SEL tools and ensure the successful protection of their application across various learning environments.  5.2 Recommendations  1.   Integrate AI-based social-emotional learning technology into the educational curriculum in order to cultivate enhanced emotional well-being and educational attainment.  2.   Provide investment in teacher training in utilizing AI technologies for implementing AI- based social-emotional learning within general education.  3.   Provide cultural sensitivity in designing AI so that the multiple ways of expressing and interpreting emotions across cultures can be addressed.  4.   Set ethical standards for using AI in learning to ensure students' emotional privacy and avoid overuse of technology for providing emotional support.  5.   Encourage   cross-disciplinary   collaboration   between   teachers,   psychologists,   and technologists   to   develop   AI   tools   that   combine   technological   ability   and   emotional understanding.  6.   Periodically assess the performance of AI tools through gathering feedback from teachers and students to refine and customize the tools according to actual implementation.  7.   Promote a culture of hybridity where AI-based solutions complement human emotional support rather than substituting for it   to   provide an integrated model   of emotional development.  8.   Promote continued studies on the long-term   psychological   effects   of   AI-based SEL technology on additional well-informed understanding of the effects of such tools on student growth and emotional well-being.  5.3 Future Implications  The application of AI-based social-emotional learning technology in teaching presents promising vistas for future individualized learning. With further development of AI technology, these tools can become increasingly adaptive and interactive to address various student needs and offer highly focused emotional support as well as individualized learning trajectories. Future development promises more sophisticated AI systems that monitor not only emotional health but also provide immediate, context-informed interventions. Furthermore, the creation of AI could promote greater coordination among schools, mental health professionals, and technologists to generate strong, ethical, and culturally responsive tools. As virtual learning environments continue to grow, the use of AI in SEL can become a foundation of effective, emotionally intelligent learning systems that can be accessed by diverse learners everywhere. But careful analysis of privacy concerns,

A quantitative  design was employed with a random sampling approach to gather  data from 271 participants. The research v erified that AI - driven  SEL technologies significantly impact emotional well - being by  delivering customized support to students and making real - time  emotional interventions through AI systems. Correlation analysis  indicated a strong positive correlation bet ween AI integration and  emotional   well - being,   and   regression   analysis   identified   AI's  significant   impact   on   emotional   support   outcomes.   Besides,  analysis using ANOVA also reaffirmed the presence of significant  performance   differences   in   AI - based   SEL   instru ments   across  demographic   characteristics   like   teaching   background   and  university category. The paper highlights the need for culturally  relevant, ethically driven AI mechanisms that enable humans to  interact freely, thereby equipping the teaching environme nt with  an even emotional support system. The findings suggest that AI -  driven SEL tools can effectively encourage a more emotionally  supportive classroom culture, provided that ethical concerns, such  as privacy and emotional authenticity, are considered.
